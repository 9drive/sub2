00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,393
[man in voiceover]
You're probably wondering
what the hell I'm doing out here

3
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:28,360
in a 110 degree heat.

4
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:32,164
I wasn't always so desperate.

5
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:37,136
At one time I made huge cash
and lived like royalty

6
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:40,039
as I gambled the nights away
with the Hollywood elite.

7
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,408
[slow music]

8
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,643
I made poker in LA hip

9
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:47,546
and made every
big hitter scratch
and crawl their way to my game.

10
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:55,254
Now...
I was the one
doing the crawling.

11
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:05,764
He looks like shit.

12
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:11,470
Relax, I just forgot
my sunblock.

13
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:18,744
[reggae music]

14
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:22,347
Yeah, I was the king
of Hollywood poker alright.

15
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,516
I thought
it would never end.

16
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:33,258
My name's Duke Madson.
I was an actor.

17
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,695
At one time
I made good money
in a whole lot of movies.

18
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:40,532
[pop song]
¶ Life is sweet, yay
Under my umbrella ¶

19
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:45,204
¶ Baba baba baraba baba
Baba Baba baba baraba ¶

20
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,443
[Duke]
After Hollywood spit me out,

21
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:55,781
I scraped by doing
pitch work and other
hack jobs to make a buck.

22
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,420
Hey! You wanna see
what else this mop can do?

23
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:04,590
[audience cheering] Yeah!

24
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:06,592
[camera beep]
[man]
Emphasis off the "can."

25
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:08,727
Like what?
Give me a reading.

26
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,829
[man]
"Wanna see what else
this mop can do?" Action!

27
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:14,633
Hey!
You wanna see
what else this mop...? Hey!

28
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,635
[man] "You wanna see
what else this mop can do?"

29
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,770
[man 2] That was nice.
[man 3] He's been drinking.

30
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,207
[man] I'd like to zoom in after.
[man 2] I'd like to zoom out.

31
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,143
[man] And action!
You know what?

32
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:26,378
You wanna hear other things?
[man] Set.

33
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,715
[man] You're doing "And..."
Okay, come on. Can do!

34
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:32,217
[man] Keep your body still.
And action!

35
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:35,654
This does everything.
It'll scratch your back.
It'll put you there.

36
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,457
You put the fucking thing
in the water.
Who gives a shit?

37
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,660
Let's hear some other
things this mop can do!

38
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,794
[audience] Oh...

39
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,535
[Duke]
After that was over,
I was broke and desperate.

40
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:53,605
To support my family,
I started up what I knew best:

41
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:54,907
A poker game.

42
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,411
Back then,
I had my regular crew.

43
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,648
Okay, are we
having fun yet, huh?

44
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,183
Here we go.
Nickel, nickel ante.

45
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:07,352
[Duke]
It was five card draw.
Seven card stud.

46
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,821
And, of course,
Texas hold 'em.

47
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,192
There was
Danny, The Magician.

48
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:17,729
He'd come
in his beat up magician's
outfit, top hat and all.

49
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,199
He was also
a terrible player.

50
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,635
Go ahead, Midge,
it's on you.

51
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:27,739
Don't call me Midge,
I'm a little person
With a big cock.

52
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:32,778
[Duke] That was Bobby Sanders.
AKA Peanut. A former
jockey at Santa Anita.

53
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,380
And, hey, can I get
a pillow for this chair?

54
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,817
I feel like I'm sitting
in a fucking coffin.
Jesus Christ!

55
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,487
[man] He's nervous for a jockey.
[Duke] My crazy brother Carl.

56
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:46,558
[Duke] Carl used to be
a top publicist in Hollywood
until he screwed that up.

57
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,363
He was a two-bit hustler,
to be honest. He was also
an incessant namedropper.

58
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:53,632
Did I tell you guys I used
to play strip poker

59
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:54,967
with Hugh Hefner
at the Playboy mansion?

60
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,969
[man] Ay...

61
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,970
But the Playmates were naked
from the beginning.
It defeated the purpose.

62
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:01,740
[man] You're told
to have stories already.
They're very bright.

63
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,276
[Duke] And then there was Wing.
Two hundred for me.

64
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:07,246
[Duke] He was a harmless
action guy I met years ago
at the racetrack.

65
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:09,548
He was
the happiest loser
I ever met.

66
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,852
Smoked me like Korean barbecue.
[man] Abracadabra!

67
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:17,990
[Duke] But the secret
to my game was to keep
everybody happy.

68
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,794
And what a game!
Over the years
it got bigger and better.

69
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,397
We were playing
two to three times a week.

70
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:28,000
Players were
coming out
of the woodwork.

71
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:31,503
My beautiful wife KC
would work the phones
like a car salesman.

72
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,538
Curt, are you in
or are you out?
I need to know.

73
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,807
[Duke] I knew
every trick and nuance
from the start.

74
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,810
When to bet,
when to bluff, and how
to read their tells.

75
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:42,748
Hey, KC, when the new guy
has a big hand, he twitches.
Write that down.

76
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,684
Okay.
And Danny the Magician. Huh?

77
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:48,820
When he's bluffing, he yawns.
It's a horrible tell.

78
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:51,390
Got it. Here we go.
He's crushing it!

79
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:55,327
We're gonna play a round
of hold 'em but limit.

80
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:57,062
[Duke] I was the ring leader.

81
00:04:57,064 --> 00:05:01,400
A friend, a drinking buddy,
and a banker.

82
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:03,935
Gentlemen!
[Duke] Money was rolling in.

83
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,007
Then came
my friend Sandor.

84
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:12,944
You wanna say it's carnival?
Let's dance. Let's dance.

85
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:17,015
[Duke] Sandor was a compulsive
gambler who came from a rich
South American family.

86
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,686
Rumor was
his mother would send him
a million dollars every year,

87
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:24,489
and by year's end,
he'd always gambled it away.

88
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,660
Another thing
that made this game great

89
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,830
was there was always
some kind of crazy prop bet.

90
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,366
[Duke] Props were side bets.
Wait a minute, I won.

91
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:36,935
We bet thousands
on all kinds of stuff.
You name it.

92
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:41,807
Oh! Oh! Get off me!
[men laughing]

93
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:44,109
[man] He's gonna lose it.
[man 2] Thirty seconds left!

94
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,778
Thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen!

95
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,682
You're gonna make it!
[Duke] Okay, great, back up.

96
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,652
[men] Go back, go back.
Fuck you! Be specific!

97
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:56,988
Your right, your right!
[man] He's gonna kill himself!

98
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,092
No, no, no, no, no!

99
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,897
[man] Damn it!
The little runt did it!

100
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:13,405
[Duke] All in all, we were
happy. We were out of debt.
Things were beautiful.

101
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,043
Hundred.
[bell ringing]
I'll go.

102
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,612
[Duke]
Then... it happened.

103
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,013
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

104
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:25,050
[Duke] A holdup.
Holy...
Fuck!

105
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:29,020
Put the fucking cash
on the table!
Now, assholes, now!

106
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,956
[Duke] He took us
for everything.
Gosh!

107
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:35,026
KC had had enough.
We had to move the game.

108
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,462
Beverly Hills.

109
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:42,467
Swimming pools,
movie stars.

110
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:48,840
I found this
perfect spot in the back room
of the Cuba Club.

111
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,777
What do you think?
This will do.

112
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,047
[Duke] With KC by my side,
the game exploded.

113
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:59,084
It became
the biggest underground
game in the city.

114
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:05,457
Doctors, lawyers,
B-level celebrities.
Nobody could play worth a damn.

115
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,793
Hey, hey, how are you?
What have I missed so far?

116
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:10,762
[Duke] Like this big guy
across the table from me,
a local attorney.

117
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,531
Sounds about right.

118
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:15,167
Duke, Rob McNeely, brother!
Nice to meet you, man.

119
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,803
[Duke] Who I found out quickly
loved to crush your hand.

120
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:20,539
From that day on,
I called him "Squeeze."

121
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,741
Ready? Right card.

122
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:26,812
[Duke] Carl would hit up
the new marks
with old school con games.

123
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:29,681
KC hosted,
did the books.

124
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:34,052
The stakes got
naturally higher,
and so did my winnings.

125
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:41,793
I was winning
so much cash, we had
to bury it in the back yard.

126
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:45,797
[KC] Watch my fingers.
Watch my fingers! Ow!

127
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,966
[Duke] Then a few years later,
the poker boom hit.

128
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,069
That guy just bet
a million with nothing!

129
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,804
[Duke] It was all over TV.

130
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,208
And everyone wanted
to play my game.

131
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:05,116
Gentlemen, I'd like you
to meet Sebastian.
Good luck.

132
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:10,922
[Duke] Sebastian Salter,
the hottest young
director in Hollywood.

133
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,258
Humble,
compassionate, unassuming.

134
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,061
These were qualities
Sebastian would never have.

135
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,499
How're you doing?
I'm Duke. I run the game.

136
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,536
I know who you are.
You're the pitch guy, huh...

137
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:28,106
You sell catheters and diapers
and all that shit.
You're very talented.

138
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,775
Glad you enjoy
the products.

139
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:33,245
[Duke] I knew
this guy was gonna be trouble.

140
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:35,747
[Duke] But I also knew
he'd be good for the game.

141
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:36,948
Yo, Sebastian.

142
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:42,187
I'm Carl, Duke's brother.
How're you doing, man?
Big fan.

143
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:46,091
I used to be a publicist.
I handled Stallone...

144
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:49,694
Oh, you handled Sly,
did you?
No, Frank.

145
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,863
Anyway, welcome
to the game, man.
Big fan, big fan!

146
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,566
Yeah, yeah. Okay.
Good to see you.

147
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:02,841
Check.
This might
break your heart.

148
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,311
Too easy,
this is too easy.

149
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:10,015
[Duke] This guy was good.
I thought I was with real men.

150
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:11,850
[Duke] And I mean very good.

151
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:16,054
What was that,
third hand tonight?
Here, sweetheart.

152
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:29,267
Hey!
Hey, Pitchman. Am I good?

153
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:33,605
Yeah. Sit down. Sit down.
Relax. Nice win.

154
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:36,608
Nice win. What?
About ten grand?

155
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,244
Eleven actually,
but who's counting?

156
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:42,013
It's barely enough
to cover a weekend
in Turks and Caicos.

157
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,750
But, I like this,
and I like what you've
done with the place.

158
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,003
This is fun.
I like it a lot.

159
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,255
Man, well, you should,
you're a good player.
You've been playing a long time?

160
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:55,260
Mm... Six months.
Yeah, about six months.

161
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,263
Yeah, I've got
a photographic memory.

162
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:03,935
IQ of 175. I don't brag about it
too much, but it's important
that you should know.

163
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:08,607
I watched a lot of poker
on TV, I learned,
now I'm basically pro level.

164
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,109
Nobody likes a bragger.

165
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,316
Anyway, enough about me.
How about you? How'd you feel
about my being here?

166
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:21,219
I don't want to make you
uncomfortable having
a ringer at the table.

167
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:24,322
It's your game.
No, you're not. You're fine.

168
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,925
You're in the game.
It's nice to hear.

169
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,194
It's nice to hear
'cause I've got a plan.

170
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:32,163
I say we get rid
of all these amateur fucks.

171
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:35,734
I mean ruin 'em. Take 'em
to the fucking cleaners.
You know what I mean?

172
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:40,305
Put 'em out on the streets.
Put down a lot of good money,
you and me.

173
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,041
All we gotta do is
get rid of the good players.

174
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:47,045
Wait. Slow down. Okay?
I can't get rid of my friends
because they win, you know?

175
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:49,314
Ah!
Just one of my rules.

176
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,150
Also we don't
rake here, you know?

177
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,719
We quit at two o'clock
and we never
cherry pick the players.

178
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,688
We have a friendly
poker game.

179
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,224
I get it.
I'll be your soldier, brother.

180
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,960
I'll be fucking Tom Hanks
in Private Ryan,
you know what I mean?

181
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,895
Only better looking.

182
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,965
[Duke]
After just a few hours
with this blowhard,

183
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:10,769
where all he did
was brag and talk about
his new found poker idols,

184
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,838
Doyle Brunson, Puggy Pearson
and Amarillo Slim...

185
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,075
Now, come on, Puggy Pearson
gave Doyle Brunson
the same bet in the eighties.

186
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:20,111
Those guys were
out of fucking control.
That's when men were men.

187
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:22,380
[Duke]
....who he always misquoted.

188
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:25,150
[Sebastian]
"If you can't spot a sailor
at the table, you're it."

189
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,819
[Duke]
Then he started bragging
about other things.

190
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:30,188
Did I tell you
I was a black belt
in karate?

191
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,825
Ay!
[Duke]  This guy was a nut bag.

192
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:38,229
[Duke] And as we say in poker,
I was priced in,
and I had to see the flaw.

193
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:51,376
[Duke] With Sebastian playing,
he brought in
some high rolling friends,

194
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:56,748
like Angry Jim, who was
in the meat packing industry.
Or something like that.

195
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,786
Hey,
assholes, help push
the chips over here.

196
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,956
You want me
to throw you down
a flight of fucking stairs?

197
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,258
I'll do it,
you motherfuckers.

198
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,761
[Duke] All I know is,
you didn't mess
with this guy.

199
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:12,430
[Duke] Then there was
Puppet Hank,

200
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:15,433
who made millions years ago
in the dot com business.

201
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,502
[Duke] He was a wannabe
ventriloquist

202
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:20,171
who never went anywhere
without his creepy puppet.

203
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:23,475
[Duke] But when he'd
go broke, he'd go
a little Tourette's.

204
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:24,409
Fuck you!

205
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:28,379
What did he say?
I didn't say shit.

206
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:31,950
This one said, "Fuck you."
Hank, put the puppet away. Okay?

207
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:36,087
Relax. Get some therapy.
Alright. Fuck you, fuck you,

208
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:40,792
bitch, bastard, bitch, bastard,
fucking shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, fuck you...

209
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:43,995
[Duke] With Sebastian in,
things were going great.

210
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:48,133
[Duke] He even livened
things up by giving Carl
an interesting free role.

211
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:53,471
[Carl] Who's got the black Audi?
[laughs]

212
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,006
Fuck, man!

213
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:58,977
Hey! Three more months,
twinkle toes!

214
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,047
If you come anywhere
without wearing your D-cup,
it's off.

215
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,850
[Duke]
My crazy brother Carl.

216
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:10,555
For fifty thousand,
he had to dress in drag
for three months. Pathetic.

217
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:16,327
[reggae music]

218
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:21,900
¶ Yeah, na boy, na ¶

219
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:24,302
¶ Okay,
Don't need no introduction ¶

220
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,204
[Duke] As the game grew,
it was very clear.

221
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,973
Sebastian was a winner.

222
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,209
How can you
fucking call that? Hm?

223
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,578
[Duke]
But I was the one player
he couldn't beat.

224
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:37,215
Lucky son of a bitch.

225
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,284
[Duke] And he hated me
because of it.

226
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,455
[Duke] As time went by,
we took lots
of gambling trips together.

227
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:47,859
Cabo, Vegas, Miami.

228
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,929
But then we always
came back to the golf.

229
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,531
Chucky Burns.

230
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,602
Television star,
drug addict, drunk...

231
00:13:57,604 --> 00:13:59,604
But just
a sweetheart of a guy.

232
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:02,574
He has no idea.
I haven't
been outside for days.

233
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:05,543
Yeah?
That's great. Alright,
we got a four-way scramble,

234
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:08,379
three ways with the cube.
I got Chucky.

235
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:13,117
I'll take Puppet Hank,
Sandor, and Carly,
2000 a man. What do you say?

236
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:16,454
No, you're not taking Carly.
She's playing on for six.
I want her on my side.

237
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,489
[Duke] Okay,
I'll take Squeeze then.

238
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,158
You take Squeeze,
but stop coning me.

239
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,493
I'm not coning you.
You're taking a piss.

240
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,262
Stop it.
Okay, I'll take drag boy then.

241
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:26,431
Nobody's taking drag boy.
Carly's staying with me.

242
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,900
[Duke] Puppet Hank.
Put down the puppet.

243
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,969
You have to put that...
You're on my team.
He's...

244
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:33,004
Put it down.
He's caddying me.
You can't have him.

245
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:36,441
I got him.
Fucking no.
Carly, you're gonna caddie me.

246
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:39,510
Carly now?
Don't make me
punch you in the vulva!

247
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:40,578
[Duke] Ah, easy!

248
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:48,152
I hit the tits off of that one!
I hit the tits off of that one!

249
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:49,954
[Carl laughing]

250
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:52,090
Well, he just ruined tits
for me the rest of my life.

251
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,463
[Duke]  We'd play all day.
Eighteen, sometimes
36 holes in one afternoon.

252
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,665
Action bets on everything.

253
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:04,402
Give me your best shots,
bitches.
Fire!

254
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,238
[Duke] Like the five grand,
hit the sucker bet
for fifty yards out,

255
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,174
where our group had
two minutes
to hurt our victim.

256
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,047
Yeah!

257
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:19,450
[moaning in pain]

258
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:24,155
[Duke] After golf,
we'd pay off the rangers.

259
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:27,292
Gentlemen!
[Duke]  Squeeze always insisted.

260
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:29,093
[Squeeze]
Thanks for your troubles.

261
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,029
Ah!

262
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:33,932
Don't worry,
I didn't forget you.

263
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,400
Oh! Jesus!

264
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:38,269
Be good, now.
Thank you. Fuck.

265
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:46,344
[Duke] Then,
it was payoff time.

266
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,348
[Duke] Afterwards,
the real laughs came

267
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,418
when the guys got drunk
and made stupid prop bets,

268
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,188
like the time
Angry Jim and Sebastian
bet 25 grand each

269
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,358
that the new golf caddie
could eat 50 donuts
in one hour.

270
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,529
And if you don't eat it,
I'm gonna fucking
stuff 'em up your ass!

271
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:06,965
[Duke] It was
an impossible feat.

272
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:10,702
[Duke] About a half hour in
and 25 donuts down...

273
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:14,472
Atta boy, you...
Don't you fucking
hurl on me!

274
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,742
[Duke] The poor kid turned
green and ran out the place
to take his one barf rule.

275
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:22,647
[Duke] But he
returned quickly,
and to everyone's surprise,

276
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:26,551
the kid ate
the other 25
and won the bet!

277
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:28,720
Beautiful! Beautiful!

278
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:30,521
[Duke] Found out
a couple months later,

279
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,657
the caddie had
an identical twin brother.

280
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,395
[Duke] Angry and Sebastian
set us up to perfection.

281
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:43,001
[Duke] You had to watch
these guys. You never knew
who was coning who.

282
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:50,408
Boys, I had
my first cigar at five
and first piece of ass at ten.

283
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,410
Was it consensual?

284
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:55,313
[men laughing]
Yeah, your mom said it was okay.

285
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,548
Got you!
Carly, close your legs.

286
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,284
I can see your balls
by your knees. Disgusting.

287
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:06,357
Listen. I've got an idea.
Walk to Vegas
in seven days... A mil.

288
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:09,627
[men whistling]
Walk to Vegas? That's...

289
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,096
Million dollars.
Interesting.

290
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:15,400
Amarillo Slim
and Doyle Brunson.
Yeah.

291
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:18,669
He laid down a bet
forty years ago.
Forty years.

292
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:21,205
No one here can do it.
I'm certainly not doing it.

293
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,707
Come on.
Prove me wrong.

294
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,276
Listen. It's easy
to figure out. Forty miles.

295
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,812
Yeah.
A day.
Because it's 280 miles.

296
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:29,547
No. It can't be done.

297
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:33,785
It's more like nine days,
maybe ten.
Or eleven.

298
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:38,256
Eleven! You can't
do that in seven days.
It's impossible, unwinnable.

299
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:40,591
Forget it. I'm not doing it.
Me, neither. No chance.

300
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:44,262
I'd be lucky to walk to the car.
[men laughing]

301
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:47,765
[Duke] But later that night,
Sebastian showed
his true colors.

302
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:55,206
[Duke] When he took Sandor
back to his house
and beat him for 250 grand.

303
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,484
[laughing]

304
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:10,088
[Duke] I found out
about it a few days later.

305
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:14,258
Oh, come on,
you're acting
like a little bitch.

306
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:19,197
I told you, Sebastian,
don't hijack my players,
especially my friend Sandor!

307
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,232
He's a grown man.
He knew what he was doing.

308
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,701
What's a fucking goat
doing here?
I asked for a camel.

309
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,803
You broke the guy
when he was
stone cold drunk!

310
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:28,539
No one's heard from him in days!
[Sebastian] I don't know.

311
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,809
Maybe he's gone back
to South America, scrounging
another mil off his mother.

312
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:34,245
I mean, the point is,
it's not my fault.

313
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:37,682
As the great hustler
Amarillo Slim used to say,

314
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:39,884
"all is fair
in a snake pit," Dukey.

315
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,520
[Duke] No, no, he said,
"I'll put a rattlesnake
in your pocket

316
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,555
and I'll ask for a match,"
you moron!

317
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,595
Alright, you ask me,
we go the car,
we get a golf club,

318
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:52,463
and we pay that creep
a visit right now.

319
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:55,633
Relax, Carl.

320
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,503
[Duke whispering] Golf club
and a car. Psycho.

321
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:05,543
[Duke] Carl was especially mad
at Sebastian due to a situation
a few days before.

322
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,246
Redheads.

323
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,750
I've always been into redheads.

324
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:17,922
Well, too bad for you.
'Cause I'm not a redhead!

325
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:20,224
Got you.

326
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:23,694
[Duke] That little incident
cost Carl fifty grand.

327
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:26,564
[Duke]
Sebastian stiffed him
on a technicality.

328
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:33,337
[Duke] As the years went by,
the game shifted to mansions,
hotels... Went to another level.

329
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,844
[Duke] My winning streak
continued.

330
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:46,250
[Duke] I kept hiding most
of our cash in the backyard.
Just in case of the unknown.

331
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,724
[Duke] Then we were playing
in this mansion
in some day game

332
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:56,227
a couple of days
before Thanksgiving.

333
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,796
[Duke] We were supposed
to quit that night,
but Walter Brooks,

334
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,800
a wealthy billionaire
friend of Sebastian's,
was just getting started.

335
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,770
[Duke] Brooks was one
of the most successful

336
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,872
diamond field
and hedge fund owners.

337
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:12,710
[Duke] He was down
over 200 grand that day,
and he didn't blink an eye.

338
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:16,280
I'll buy another fifty, please.
Me, too.

339
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,749
[Duke] Then there was
Chucky Burns.

340
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:22,486
[Duke] The drunken,
drug-addicted sitcom star
having his own struggles.

341
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:31,562
[Duke] This was
the game of games.
The perfect storm.

342
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,665
[Duke] The problem was
we played right
into Thanksgiving Day,

343
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,801
and no one
had any thoughts of leaving.

344
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,937
[KC] You know that we are
four hours away
from people arriving.

345
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:42,673
[KC] Where the hell are you?
I'm killing it here.

346
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:46,010
I'm in the greatest
game of all time! This could
change our entire life!

347
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:49,647
If you don't get home soon,
I'm gonna change
your entire life!

348
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,649
[whispering] No! No, get out.

349
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:02,760
[Duke] Chucky lost a record
seven hundred thousand.

350
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,399
[Duke]
I won two hundred
and fifty thousand of it.

351
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:13,638
[Duke] The biggest score
of my entire life.

352
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:18,276
[Duke] A few weeks later,
Angry Jim came by

353
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:22,413
to pick up money I owed
him from a boxing bet,
about 10 grand.

354
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:30,721
[sighing]

355
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:33,891
You made me come out
to the San Fernando Valley.

356
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:38,462
You know they got
poison gases out here
that the government covers up.

357
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,931
Oh,
by the way, did you hear?

358
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:43,501
That actor prick, Chucky?

359
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:46,470
His check bounced.
Yeah I know,
I know. Mine too.

360
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,874
He owes me two fifty.
Don't worry about him.
He's very good for it.

361
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:55,413
Yeah. Well if he's not,
I'm gonna rip out his eyes
and rape his fuckin' skull.

362
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,582
A little much?
Maybe.

363
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:00,618
My blood sugar's low.

364
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:04,655
[Duke] Is that Carl?
[groaning]

365
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:11,028
[groaning]
Carl! What happened?

366
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,997
Carl! Oh!
What happened?

367
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,766
They took my car.
They accused me of cheating.

368
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,468
Who? Who accused
you of cheating?

369
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,937
The Mexicans,
in the Calexico game!

370
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:23,374
They said
I had phony dice!
Did you?

371
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,510
Duke! That's out of line!
Out of line!

372
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:29,647
How stupid do I look?
[Duke] That meant "yes."

373
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:33,451
[Duke] For years Carl
would run down to this
border town game in Calexico

374
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:37,688
in the back of a seedy bar
and roll dice
with scum bags and gangsters.

375
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,457
[Duke]
It was just a matter of time.

376
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:42,026
Anyway, they took me out
back in the alley.

377
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:45,029
Threw hot sauce
in my eyes. Hot sauce!

378
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,832
And then the last thing
I remember,
they're beating my knee.

379
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:50,067
Look at this.
Beating my knee
with a frying pan.

380
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:54,038
[Angry] Frying pan?
Fucking Mexicans.
Always thinking of food.

381
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,941
[Angry laughing] Okay, alright.
That's not funny.

382
00:22:58,111 --> 00:23:01,679
Hey.
Can you pay this guy?
They took my whole roll.

383
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:04,382
Yeah. Yeah.
No, I got it. I got it.

384
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,016
[Angry] I got you covered.
[Carl] My God!

385
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:07,885
Can I stay for supper?
[Angry] Here you go.

386
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,688
I'm starving.

387
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,058
[Duke] From that day on,
my brother walked on sticks.

388
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:19,897
About a month later,
Walter Brooks flew us all out
to his Napa Valley vineyard.

389
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:24,568
It was to celebrate
this new fancy wine he acquired
for a zillion dollars .

390
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:30,107
We were all having
a blast, higher
than the state of Colorado,

391
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:32,710
before the temple
of doom cornered me.

392
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:36,514
That actor prick Chucky...
He still hasn't paid me.

393
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:38,616
I know, I know, Angry.
He's good for it.

394
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:42,453
Oh, man.
Fucking pisses me off!
Bad debts ruin games.

395
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:44,522
You know
what I ought to do?

396
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:47,124
I ought to throw
that cocksucker down
a fucking flight of stairs!

397
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,627
Easy, Godfather.
He'll pay.

398
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:52,830
[Duke] I sounded confident,
but I was owed
a lot of money, too.

399
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,732
[Duke]
Chucky was back in rehab.

400
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:57,935
[man whistling]
[clinking glass]

401
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:01,138
[applause]

402
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,141
Thank you,
thank you, one and all.

403
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:08,646
[Walter] I want to begin
by welcoming
all of you to my home.

404
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:12,516
Even my degenerate group
of gambling friends

405
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:14,685
who have
set such a terrible
example for me.

406
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:16,487
[laughter]

407
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:21,525
But seriously,
I am a very lucky man.

408
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:26,897
[Walter] But wealth is
of no value unless you have
friends with which to share it.

409
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:33,537
I regard
each and every one of you
as my friend.

410
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,206
[laughing]

411
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:37,541
And because
you are my friend,
you are my family.

412
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:41,545
[Walter] It would honor me
greatly if you would
accept my invitation

413
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:45,249
to participate
in my extraordinary
good fortune.

414
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,587
Hear, hear!
[applause]

415
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,689
[Duke]
Checkmate.
Slam dunk, over!

416
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:53,891
[Duke]
The most successful
business man in the world

417
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:56,560
just gave us an "in"
to all his investment riches.

418
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:59,897
[Duke]  Impossible
for the ordinary man.
But we were chosen.

419
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:01,899
Congratulations.

420
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:04,268
[Duke]
As bad as Sebastian was,
I owed him for this one.

421
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:09,974
[Duke] When I got back to LA,
I rounded up
practically all of our money.

422
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:15,713
[Duke] Total about 1.2 million
and wired it immediately in
to Walter's main hedge fund.

423
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:19,850
[Duke] Deep down, I knew
money really couldn't
bring you happiness.

424
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:23,621
[Duke] But right now,
we weren't very deep,
and we were really happy.

425
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,725
[Duke] Time went by
and all was well,

426
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:31,795
even though Chucky
went sideways
and never paid anyone.

427
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,932
[Duke]
Then, the day got real bad.

428
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,269
We are following
breaking news tonight.

429
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:40,938
We've learned
that billionaire Walter Brooks,

430
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,841
chairman of one
of the most successful
venture capital firms,

431
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:45,676
has been indicted
by the US Government

432
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:48,212
for what appears to be
running a Ponzi scheme.

433
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,915
Now his whereabouts
are unknown at this time,

434
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:55,119
leaving disgruntled
investors in ruins
and desperate for answers.

435
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:56,320
What?

436
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:01,325
[KC] No!

437
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:07,698
[Duke] After days
of phone calls
to lawyers, cops, even FBI,

438
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,200
we finally realized
that our money was gone.

439
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:15,973
[Duke] The worst
part about it is
that Sebastian told people

440
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:19,677
he never really trusted Brooks
and never invested a dime.

441
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:25,583
[Duke] To make
matters worse,
he was having a game.

442
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:27,785
[Duke]
My game with my players.

443
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:30,154
I got a knife and duct tape!
And I'm bringing it!

444
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:32,723
Who do you think we are?
The Sopranos?
Get back in the car.

445
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:38,228
[Duke] Where's Sebastian?

446
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:47,805
What is
all the excitement? Huh?

447
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:49,707
Ah! Dukemeister.

448
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:52,910
What the hell's going on?

449
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:54,945
You're relieved, big man.
Thank you.

450
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,914
What's that?
What're you talking about?

451
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,983
What are you doing?
You having a game?

452
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:01,218
My game? And you
don't invite me?

453
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:04,855
This is
a hundred grand buy in.
You told me you're broke.

454
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:06,690
You're trying
to steal my game.

455
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:08,092
Wah!

456
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:14,632
Duke, remember.
I'm sixth degree in black belt
on martial arts scale.

457
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,901
Do not make me
karate the fuck at you.

458
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:26,210
Okay.
But for the record,
it's fifth degree black belt.

459
00:27:26,212 --> 00:27:27,945
It only goes up
to fifth degree!

460
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:30,147
Not in Europe. It's
a different fucking scale!

461
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,282
Different scale? Really?
It's the metric system!

462
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:33,851
Explain.
What do you mean explain?

463
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:35,853
Didn't you go to school?
Yes, I did!

464
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:37,788
Right!
Well, the metric system!

465
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,722
What are you talking about?
The European metric system!

466
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:41,392
I know the metric system!

467
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:47,097
Is it fifth?

468
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,899
Fuck!
That's embarrassing.

469
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:56,173
[Duke] With my game stolen
and my bankroll destroyed,

470
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,443
I quickly tried to collect
on my Chucky Burns marker.

471
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:02,813
[Duke] This whack job
did owe me
a quarter of a million dollars.

472
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:07,251
Hey!

473
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:10,020
Hey! Hey! You look good.

474
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,722
You look good.
Thanks. You?

475
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:13,724
Yeah. I'm fine.
You look good.

476
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:16,927
You look good.
Very healthy.

477
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:21,165
[Duke]
Look, I got a problem.

478
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,301
I'm really busted.
I need money.

479
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:28,706
You owe me some money.
Two hundred
and fifty thousand.

480
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:32,743
[nervous laugh]

481
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:36,714
Do I really owe you
a quarter of a million?

482
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:41,185
I'm not doubting you.
I just have
no memory of it.

483
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:45,155
Yes. Yes, you owe me
250 000 dollars.

484
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:48,025
Remember the Thanksgiving
game? You got gobbled up.

485
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:50,127
Right. Right.

486
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:00,337
Can I offer you a line?
No.

487
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:03,107
You want some of these?
No.

488
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:04,775
Some of these?
No.

489
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:06,210
Some of this?
No.

490
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:10,047
Okay. So...

491
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,754
I wanna pay you.
I wanna pay you the money.

492
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:19,823
Thank God. Thank God.
I knew you'd come through.
Thank you!

493
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:21,291
But I'm broke.

494
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:24,428
You're broke.

495
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:27,264
Yeah. No one's
fucking hiring me anymore.

496
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,365
I don't get it.

497
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:31,769
Well, it's
a shock to me.

498
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:34,071
Look, I'll see you around.

499
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:38,909
Hey Duke! Hey,
uh, hey Duke. Duke?

500
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:42,279
I'm really sorry.

501
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:45,983
Hey, don't worry.

502
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:51,522
My old man used to tell me
everyone goes broke,
only bums don't come back.

503
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:53,257
You're not a bum.

504
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,959
No, I'm not a bum.

505
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,197
Winner. I'm a winner!

506
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:05,202
I'm a winner! Whoo!

507
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:11,074
[Duke]
Months went by
and things got worse.

508
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,111
[Duke]
I was dead broke
with bills to pay

509
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:16,246
and a family who acted
like I didn't exist.

510
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,817
Hey! Love you guys!

511
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:21,885
Yeah, right dad, right!

512
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:24,822
[phone ringing]

513
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:26,323
[Duke]
Then... a break.

514
00:30:28,561 --> 00:30:29,493
Hello?

515
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:34,998
[Duke] A call
from Sebastian to meet.
He said he had good news.

516
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,167
[Duke]  I was at his house
in twenty minutes.

517
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,369
Beautiful, last, we'll
sink a little bit lower

518
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:41,305
with each out breath,
each inhale,

519
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:43,407
lengthen,
from middle sternum
to crown of the head,

520
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:46,210
each exhale sink
a little bit lower,

521
00:30:46,212 --> 00:30:48,378
there we go. One more in,
press your in...
Hey.

522
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,546
Now let's move...

523
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:51,982
[Sebastian] Get me
a nice towel.

524
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:56,286
Namaste, Duke.

525
00:30:57,156 --> 00:31:00,991
So, why am I here?
To watch you
audition for Peter Pan?

526
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:03,327
What, does this make
you uncomfortable? Hmm?

527
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:08,198
Listen,
the reason you're here.

528
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:12,135
I know you've had
a tough time
with Walter Brooks.

529
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:16,139
I know
that prick Chucky
still owes you some dough.

530
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:19,543
So I'd like
to buy Chucky's marker
off of you.

531
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:21,478
Really?

532
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:24,414
It's worth 250 grand.

533
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:29,219
Yeah, but rumor has it,
he is one foot in the grave
and he's MC Hammer broke.

534
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:33,190
You know?
So, I'm thinking,
I'll buy his marker.

535
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,560
Maybe it pays off
in ten years.
Maybe it don't.

536
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:39,897
But for forty grand,
it might be with worth it.

537
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,432
Forty grand! No,
that's ridiculous.

538
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,636
Okay. I knew you'd bargain.

539
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:50,107
I'm willing to go up.
Sixty. But not more.

540
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:53,310
I'll take it.

541
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,480
Of course you will.

542
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:01,952
[Duke]
With the sixty grand,
I laid low for a while.

543
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:05,455
[Duke] And waited
for the right game.

544
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:10,694
[Duke] A thing happens
when you're used to playing

545
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:13,397
for a hundred grand
and now you're
playing for ten.

546
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:19,603
[Duke] You play bad.
I lost the entire sixty
in one night.

547
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:31,982
So... we're down
to the two dollar
tequila now, huh?

548
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:34,251
Pathetic.

549
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,990
Here's some bad news.

550
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:46,363
What? What is this?

551
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:51,301
Yeah. Great timing
to sell to Sebastian.

552
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:56,306
Chucky's rich again.
I heard he paid Sebastian
back the 250 K weeks ago.

553
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:01,411
It gets worse.
Read the part about who's
executive producing the show.

554
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:04,982
Sebastian.
Oh, my God! No, no!

555
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:07,451
Which means Sebastian knew
he was doing the show

556
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:10,120
and he couldn't wait
to hustle you.
Fucking...!

557
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:14,558
You better just straighten up,
you drunken fool. Alright?

558
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,994
You just got robbed again
by that scumbag!

559
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:21,331
Time to get
your balls back.

560
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:24,501
Let's snap this guy.

561
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:33,210
[Duke]
About a week later,
I met up with Angry Jim.

562
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:36,313
[Duke] I was gonna try
and sell him my golf clubs
for two hundred bucks

563
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:38,482
even though
they were probably
still worth a grand.

564
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:40,250
[Duke] I was
desperate for money.

565
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:44,388
You made me
come out to the valley
again for these?

566
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,424
These clubs look like
they've been through a war.

567
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,460
[Duke] Yeah.
[phone ringing]

568
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:52,029
Hello.

569
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:58,368
What?

570
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:04,775
[Duke] Sandor was dead.
He had a heart attack
at the racetrack.

571
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:14,818
Sandor was
a very special guy.

572
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:17,454
True gambler.

573
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,827
A man with great passion
and many, many friends.

574
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:29,433
Don't seem like to me.
There's what? Eight people?

575
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:33,703
If you were broke,
Sandor would give you money.

576
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:36,106
He wasn't about himself.

577
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:39,276
Unlike
other people in this room.

578
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:42,379
I think he's talking
about you.

579
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:45,115
He was about giving.
Oh, he gave.

580
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:48,185
He still owes me
like twenty five grand.

581
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:51,221
Welcher, welcher...
Hey, come on.

582
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:53,690
Sandor,
you were a great man.

583
00:34:55,194 --> 00:34:56,660
May the river card
always hit you.

584
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:01,398
I'm sorry. So sorry.

585
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:09,106
You know, I think
I'd like to say
a little something.

586
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:13,510
Hey! You can't say a damn word!
What? I'm paying my respect.

587
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:15,712
Respects? Respect him?
Yeah.

588
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:17,681
You didn't respect him
when you broke him

589
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:20,150
for 250 000 when he was
stone cold drunk, did you?

590
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:22,352
Why are you
bringing that up now?

591
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:24,287
Sit down.
You sit down.

592
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,157
I will sit down. You sit down.
I stood up first. You sit down.

593
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,525
Sorry.
He's very emotional.

594
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:30,293
He's emotional.
My apologies.

595
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,828
He's emotional right now.

596
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,530
Sit down.
You sit down.

597
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:36,299
No, you sit down.
Sit down.

598
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,235
I'm gonna sit down.
Sit down.

599
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:40,904
He's insensitive.
Insensitive! Yes!

600
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:55,719
[knocking on wood]
It's a nice fucking box.
What is that, oak?

601
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:58,655
I'm very sorry
for your loss.
Thank you.

602
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,858
[woman struggling]

603
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:10,167
[sighing]
Hi, Papiana.

604
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:12,602
Oh!
I'm so sorry!

605
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:15,205
Oh, sweetie,
that was so beautiful.

606
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:16,940
Thank you. Thank you.

607
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:20,177
And thank you
for what you said
about my brother.

608
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:22,679
Thank you.
Anyway, uh...

609
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:28,451
Every year my mother would
send Sandor a sum of money
to enjoy his life with.

610
00:36:28,453 --> 00:36:30,420
Right.
Anyway...

611
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:33,323
In honor of Sandor
and your friendship,

612
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:36,860
my mother and I
would like you to have this.

613
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:38,628
Oh.

614
00:36:39,765 --> 00:36:40,931
[Wing] What is it?

615
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:46,670
[Wing] You're kidding! No way!
Holy fuck! Oh my God! Oh my God!

616
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:48,939
[Wing]
Duke just inherited
a million dollars!

617
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:52,876
We're saved.
We won't lose the house!

618
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:55,779
[Angry]
Wow! Duke's rolling in
the big money now, huh.

619
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:59,683
[Wing] Woohoo!
My grandpa used to say

620
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:02,419
sometimes good can
come from sorrow.

621
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:08,291
Hey, listen.
Perhaps with this,
maybe the old man here

622
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:11,795
could buy his way
back in my game
with this sort of money.

623
00:37:11,797 --> 00:37:14,431
Relax, conman.
I'll never play
in your game again.

624
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:16,800
Why are you calling me names?
Why is he being so hostile?

625
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:18,635
I was just coming over
to congratulate you.

626
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:20,804
No, you weren't.
You came over here
because of this.

627
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:23,506
We have a little money
again that we can
get out of debt with.

628
00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:25,442
You want to hustle it.
I know you.

629
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:27,444
But I don't want your money.
Good! Good.

630
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:29,746
Now please leave
before I bust your face!
How about that?

631
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,615
[Wing] Hey, come on guys.
He's mean to me.

632
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:35,352
Now I am mad, I do want
your fucking money.
Hey, hey!

633
00:37:35,354 --> 00:37:36,686
You want my money.

634
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:39,389
He is bragging
about how he wins any prop.

635
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:41,491
Smartest man
in the room. Right, Duke?

636
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:42,859
Don't know
what you're talking about.

637
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:45,662
Why don't
you put your money
where your mouth is?

638
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:47,631
You pick a prop.
Anything. Sound fair?

639
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,568
Head's up at poker?
Game of golf.
Whatever you want.

640
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,004
Be a big man.
Put your money down.

641
00:37:55,474 --> 00:37:56,973
You're not really thinking...

642
00:37:59,845 --> 00:38:01,445
Babe, stay out of this.
You know what I think?

643
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,046
I think the problem
is that you've played
the knowing gambler too long.

644
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,548
You're a has been
who just wants to play

645
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,484
in his shitty
little valley game.

646
00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:10,854
I'll do it!
Get your million ready.

647
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:13,023
[Wing] Oh, no. Oh God.
Are you crazy?

648
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:15,492
We got our life back,
now you want
to risk everything?

649
00:38:15,494 --> 00:38:18,028
Babe, Sandor
would've wanted this.
I've got the edge.

650
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,929
We'll win.
Who's crushing it?

651
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:23,700
Not you!
You're on your own!

652
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:28,004
This is without me.
[Angry] That was awkward.

653
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:31,675
So, what's the bet gonna be?

654
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:37,047
A million dollar
walk to Vegas!

655
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:42,352
Very sexy!
Okay assholes, the bet is on!

656
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,989
Either one of you
guys pulls out now,
you owe a hundred grand.

657
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:49,759
[Angry] After tonight,
it's two hundred!
The overall bet is a million.

658
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:55,365
Extra betting is encouraged.
Let's do this!

659
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,836
[Duke] We bickered
for hours going over
every little detail.

660
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:02,505
Okay,
so three times a day
for fifteen minutes,

661
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:07,644
Duke can come into the RV,
use the restroom,
the shower if he so pleases.

662
00:39:07,646 --> 00:39:10,880
No! Twice a day!
Tops. That's it. I'm not
running a fucking hotel.

663
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:14,351
[Duke]
Most of the big issues
were settled on.

664
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:18,855
[Duke] I had to sleep outside,
I could walk or run,
90 % in the daytime,

665
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:23,126
no hats allowed,
and I could only eat or drink
what I packed in my bag.

666
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:28,765
Now let's talk
about the biggest
issue of all: days.

667
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:32,602
Wait, wait. What's he
talking about? We decided
it was going to be nine days.

668
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:35,605
No, we said
eight or nine days
to be negotiated.

669
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:37,073
But I'm
leaning towards eight.

670
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:40,143
Guys, get serious.
I'm 48 years old.

671
00:39:40,145 --> 00:39:44,514
Okay, the walk to Vegas
in eight days is
36 miles a day. Impossible.

672
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:46,649
Yeah. There's no way
he's going to make that.

673
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:48,718
Look at him.
He's an old drunk.

674
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:50,887
Sorry, Duke.

675
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,957
No worries.
[Angry] He does drink a lot.

676
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:55,525
That is true.

677
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:56,826
[Hank]
Fuck, shit, fuck, shit.

678
00:39:56,828 --> 00:40:00,764
Boys, he's
been playing professional
tennis his whole life.

679
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,767
He works out twice a day.
He's conning us.

680
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:07,537
No, it's eight days.
Take it or leave it.

681
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:16,780
Okay, you got me! Eight days.

682
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:20,417
And as long as you're
stealing my money,
how about this one?

683
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:22,919
How about seven days?
[man] What?

684
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,821
What are you talking about?
You're kidding?

685
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:29,692
I'll do it in seven days
in the tradition
of the Doyle Brunson bet.

686
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:34,597
But Doyle was 32
when he made that bet.

687
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:39,169
He was in superior shape.
He could run a marathon
in three hours in his sleep.

688
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:42,806
[man] Damn right.
I suppose you'd want odds on it.

689
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:45,875
Yes, of course,
I want odds. Big odds,
or I'm out of here.

690
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:47,844
[man] That's right!
That's crazy!

691
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:51,014
No, it's not. Seven
days to walk to Vegas
at 48 years old,

692
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:53,683
a semi drunk
in hot desert heat?

693
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:58,755
Give us a break. He could
never do it, so it's gotta be
twenty to one, at least.

694
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:00,190
[man] Yeah.
[man 2] Thirty!

695
00:41:00,192 --> 00:41:02,158
[man] Thirty to one!
That's what I'm thinking.

696
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,827
What do you think
we should give him?

697
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,763
You think
he can actually make it?

698
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:11,734
It can't be done.
Not by him.
It's a fucking lock.

699
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,105
Alright, alright.
Here we are. Here we are.

700
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:20,810
In the tradition
of the Doyle bet,
we do it in seven days.

701
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:24,481
But big man here's
gotta wear a suit.
What? What?

702
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:27,550
A suit? You want me to wear
a suit in the desert?
Are you crazy?

703
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:30,119
[Sebastian] That was
part of the original bet
and you know it.

704
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:34,123
Seven days, you in a suit.
I'll give you
five to one.

705
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:38,695
This is crazy.
You know Doyle
never made the bet?

706
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:43,933
He stopped. He pulled
off because he knew it was
impossible to win. Yeah.

707
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:46,870
Yeah, because you knew
about the suit,
which I'm impressed by,

708
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:50,139
you must also know
about the Jack Binion clause.

709
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:52,775
That his best friend
Jack Binion could
actually relieve him

710
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:54,611
the last 25
miles if need be.

711
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,546
That's it?

712
00:41:56,548 --> 00:42:01,651
That's all you're whining about
as our sticking point?
Fuck. Alright. Deal.

713
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:04,087
[Duke] Deal.

714
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:06,256
You'd better warm up some.

715
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:11,794
[Duke]
With only ten days to prepare,
I had to move fast.

716
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:15,098
[pop song]

717
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,738
¶ You calm down, calm down ¶

718
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,874
[Duke] To make it official,
all the money was put
into an escrow account.

719
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,828
[Duke] Very reputable.

720
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:31,613
¶ And I'm bound, I'm bound
In all our place ¶

721
00:42:31,616 --> 00:42:33,983
¶ There is no sound
No sound ¶

722
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:37,287
[Duke] I hadn't worked out
this hard in years.
But I was feeling great.

723
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:39,088
Hi, neighbor!
Fuck you!

724
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:47,897
¶ Ey, ey ¶

725
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:54,103
I'm the king
of the Valley!

726
00:42:58,343 --> 00:43:01,110
I'm ready to go.
Where are these guys?

727
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:04,614
They said noon.
Yeah.

728
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:10,086
[musical car horn]

729
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,257
[man on speaker]
Welcome, K-Mart shoppers!

730
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:21,664
Oh! Oh! Lookin' sharp!

731
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:25,201
So this is what
a Valley looks like, huh?

732
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:27,837
Sweet RV, Sebastian!

733
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,005
Suck a dick, Carl.

734
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:30,640
[Carl] Yeah...

735
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:32,275
Where's the missus?
Where's the boy at?

736
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:34,344
I thought you guys
would be celebrating.

737
00:43:34,346 --> 00:43:36,379
Have some confetti,
some balloons.

738
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:38,781
I got my family covered.
Don't worry about it.

739
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:44,387
Okay guys,
Pops is leaving!
I love you!

740
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,024
Fuck you!
[door closing]

741
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,760
In case you don't know,
they still aren't talking.

742
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:51,894
I fucking got it, Carl!

743
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:56,633
Alright,
love, ready, huh?
I wanna get out of here.

744
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:58,134
This Valley smog
is burning my eyes.

745
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:01,270
Yeah.

746
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,875
[Hank laughing]
Bye-bye.

747
00:44:05,877 --> 00:44:11,714
Okay, million dollar
walk to Vegas, begins now!

748
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:14,951
[Duke] 280 miles
to the Vegas sign.

749
00:44:14,953 --> 00:44:16,719
I had to win this bet.

750
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:21,791
I chose to wear the suit
that I proposed to KC in,
13 years ago.

751
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:23,292
It was my lucky suit.

752
00:44:23,294 --> 00:44:30,066
I took the old back
route from the north end of the
Valley through Santa Clarita.

753
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:36,339
All the guys
had action on the bet,

754
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:40,243
most taking pieces
on Sebastian's side.

755
00:44:40,245 --> 00:44:42,779
[Duke] Just Wing and Carl
making bets on me.

756
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:46,783
[musical car horn]

757
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:51,854
[man in speaker]
Hey, Dukey, we're all
having ice cream sandwiches.

758
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:54,724
[man] I don't wanna brag,
but we are having
ice cream sandwiches.

759
00:44:57,062 --> 00:44:59,128
[Duke] I got
through 40 miles
on day one.

760
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:01,230
[Duke]
I was right on schedule.

761
00:45:01,232 --> 00:45:03,700
[animals howling and barking]

762
00:45:03,702 --> 00:45:06,936
Thank you!
Thank you, coyotes!

763
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:09,272
I'll be here all week!

764
00:45:10,442 --> 00:45:14,110
I can't believe the bastard
made Vasquez Rocks
on the first day!

765
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:19,816
Vasquez Rocks? Isn't that
where Rock Hudson shot
that movie "Rio Bravo"

766
00:45:19,818 --> 00:45:21,751
where he killed
all those Indians?

767
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:24,087
I don't care.
No, incorrect.

768
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:25,855
That would be John Wayne.

769
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:29,292
Did I ever tell you
I handled his son Patrick
back in the day?

770
00:45:29,294 --> 00:45:32,328
You didn't. But you know what?
I'm having trouble
sleeping at night,

771
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:35,498
so why don't
you call me later
and retell that story?

772
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:44,974
[Duke] Day two
I hit it early
and sprung down the road.

773
00:45:45,777 --> 00:45:49,212
[Duke] I cruised down
Pearblossom Highway.
And was making time.

774
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:53,316
[Duke] I breezed
through the mountains
like it was nothing.

775
00:45:58,156 --> 00:46:00,790
[Duke] It was hot,
but I was kicking ass!

776
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:04,393
[Duke]  With the beautiful sun
shining down, I was strong
and full of vitamin D.

777
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:06,062
[Duke] My body
was in its zone.

778
00:46:06,064 --> 00:46:10,066
[Duke] I was excited
about life and at total peace
with the world.

779
00:46:11,002 --> 00:46:13,169
Yo, Pops!
You're fucking sick!

780
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:15,004
[laughing]

781
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:19,942
Come on, punks!

782
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:29,285
[Duke]  Fucking millennials.
They think they're all hot shit
with their craft beer.

783
00:46:32,557 --> 00:46:37,894
After that debacle,
I started to hurt and slow down.

784
00:46:40,165 --> 00:46:43,166
Around noon time,
I felt tingling
around my neck.

785
00:46:43,168 --> 00:46:44,901
The start of heat stroke.

786
00:46:48,907 --> 00:46:52,275
Alright, 15 minute
RV break starts now!

787
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:53,843
Give him room!

788
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:56,846
[Carl] Okay! Okay,
here he comes.

789
00:46:56,848 --> 00:47:00,049
[Carl] Here comes the champ.
You know something?
You're getting a good tan.

790
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:01,851
[Carl] Uh oh.

791
00:47:03,922 --> 00:47:06,389
Someone give him
a cell phone.
So he can call the misses.

792
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:10,493
Too soon?

793
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,428
I take it back.

794
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:17,567
Oh, my gosh! Yeah, it takes
a real tough guy
to hit a child.

795
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,903
[Carl]
Hey! You're looking good.

796
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:25,274
[Carl] And you're feeling good!
[Duke vomiting]

797
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:28,277
He's fine.

798
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:32,882
[Duke] That afternoon,
I was dragging.

799
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:37,854
But with five million dollars
to win, I pushed on.

800
00:47:42,994 --> 00:47:45,261
There were times
I'd get ahead of the RV.

801
00:47:45,263 --> 00:47:49,232
They'd stall,
have lunch or go to some
sleazy strip joint.

802
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:54,270
I cut across
a lot of open desert
to make better time.

803
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:57,907
Of course,
Sebastian wouldn't trust me,

804
00:47:59,978 --> 00:48:03,479
so he hired this scout
to walk behind me
about a half mile away

805
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:08,017
just in case a motorcycle
didn't pick me up and drive me
ten miles down the road.

806
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:09,919
[Angry]
Oh, we're fucked.

807
00:48:09,921 --> 00:48:13,623
Duke's already gone
a hundred miles in two days.

808
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:15,925
That guy's a fucking machine.
Nah.

809
00:48:15,927 --> 00:48:18,628
We'll be alright.
He'll tire out
after day three.

810
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:21,163
Nobody beats
a fucking desert.
Trust me.

811
00:48:21,165 --> 00:48:23,099
[door knocking]
Check or bet.

812
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:26,235
Hey, guys,
it's too hot in here.
I need some water.

813
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,471
Wonton,
get the fuck back in there.

814
00:48:28,473 --> 00:48:30,640
You pop out again,
you lose the bet!

815
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:34,477
[Hank]
Water? He wants water?
I don't think so.

816
00:48:34,479 --> 00:48:36,512
[laughter]

817
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,620
[Duke]
By the end of day two
I was exhausted.

818
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:48,157
And with everything at stake,
I went into autopilot,

819
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:50,393
and made Victorville
before nightfall.

820
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:02,071
Day three.
Way ahead of schedule.

821
00:49:03,408 --> 00:49:05,508
My body
feeling surprisingly good.

822
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:06,943
I was off.

823
00:49:11,482 --> 00:49:14,984
[police siren sound]
[man in speaker] Pull over.

824
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,719
[police siren sound]

825
00:49:21,259 --> 00:49:23,025
[Sebastian]
What is this about?

826
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:25,294
I stopped
you because you're
slowing down traffic.

827
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:28,664
Ugh...I don't have
time for this. I mean,
clearly, you're insane.

828
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:32,601
How are we slowing down
traffic when there is
no fucking traffic?

829
00:49:33,738 --> 00:49:35,738
Jesus Christ! Look,

830
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:39,575
I know for a fact
that we paid
all you hillbilly cops off.

831
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:41,477
Rather handsomely,
I may add.

832
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:43,479
Who you calling a hillbilly?
You.

833
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:46,282
Hey! What's the problem?
What's the problem?

834
00:49:46,284 --> 00:49:48,384
This silly hick fuck
wants to shut us down.

835
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:51,320
Hey, sir,
return to your vehicle! Now!

836
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:54,223
My what?
Return to your vehicle now.

837
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,193
Do it!
[Sebastian] What did he say?

838
00:49:57,195 --> 00:49:59,061
[Duke] Let go!
[Sebastian] My vehicle?

839
00:49:59,063 --> 00:50:01,030
[Sebastian]
They don't even
speak English.

840
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:04,567
There they go with their guns.
Get in there!

841
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:06,402
For fuck sake.
Officer.

842
00:50:06,404 --> 00:50:08,637
Vehicles. It's not even a word!
Officer. Can I explain?

843
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:11,407
My name's Duke.
I apologize for that guy.
He's a movie director.

844
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:12,641
Oh, I know who he is.

845
00:50:13,411 --> 00:50:15,411
And you Hollywood pricks
think you can get away

846
00:50:15,413 --> 00:50:17,513
with whatever
you want, don't you?

847
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:20,016
Yeah, actually,
I agree with you
about Hollywood pricks.

848
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:23,019
They all are.
I used to be an actor
in Hollywood myself. Yeah.

849
00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:26,689
But anyway,
that guy in there,
trust me,

850
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:29,125
he's the biggest
Hollywood prick
you'll ever meet.

851
00:50:29,127 --> 00:50:33,129
You know what?
I'm broke because
of that prick. Yeah.

852
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:36,465
I can't support my wife
and my kid. Honest to God
because of that prick.

853
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:41,437
And, sadly I made a bet
with that stupid prick

854
00:50:41,439 --> 00:50:45,574
that I can, it's crazy,
walk to Vegas in seven days.

855
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:47,376
A walk to Vegas?

856
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:51,047
Are you out of your mind?
Yeah.

857
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:53,549
Maybe I am. I don't know.
But I'm doing it.
I'm out here right now!

858
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:56,318
I'm half way through
and, officer,
if you stop me now,

859
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,422
I will lose,
that prick
will have ruined me.

860
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:04,643
I don't know what I'll do.

861
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:05,593
I'm sorry
I called you a silly fuck.

862
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:09,365
Wow, he really is
a prick, isn't he?

863
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:17,106
Well, listen.
You got a bet to win.

864
00:51:19,544 --> 00:51:20,843
And I'm not gonna stop you.

865
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:23,779
You're not? Really?

866
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:27,349
That's great! Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

867
00:51:28,386 --> 00:51:33,756
You know what the difference
between a porcupine and a bus
full of Hollywood types is?

868
00:51:35,326 --> 00:51:39,528
No, not really.
Don't know.
I don't know.

869
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:42,164
The porcupine
has his pricks
on the outside.

870
00:51:45,169 --> 00:51:47,336
That... That's funny.

871
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:51,340
That's the porcupine
reference... That's good.

872
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:53,242
Yeah, yeah.
I just made that one up.

873
00:51:53,244 --> 00:51:55,377
Yeah, we got
a little comedy
club in Lancaster.

874
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:57,546
Sometimes, I go
in there and I...
It's a hobby.

875
00:51:57,548 --> 00:52:00,683
I try out some stuff.
That's clever stuff.

876
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:02,718
Great sense of humor.

877
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,355
If I was you, I would
get off this road.

878
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:08,757
You wanna head out up
over that mountain there.

879
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:10,759
It's a little terrain,
but you're gonna be fine.

880
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:12,495
The road bends back around.

881
00:52:12,497 --> 00:52:14,864
It's gonna be
a real shortcut,
save you a few hours.

882
00:52:14,866 --> 00:52:16,765
No, you're kidding.
That's beautiful.

883
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,868
Officer,
I can't thank you enough.
You are...

884
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:22,505
I'm so sorry about him,
and you're fantastic!
And you're funny.

885
00:52:23,207 --> 00:52:24,373
It's been a real pleasure.

886
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:26,242
Oh.
Yeah. Real actor.

887
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:27,543
Meeting a real actor.

888
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:29,645
You ever been
in anything I'd ever seen?

889
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:32,148
Never.
Probably never. Way back.
Thank you though.

890
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,782
No, I've seen
your face before.
I know you.

891
00:52:33,784 --> 00:52:35,451
Could I give you my card?

892
00:52:35,887 --> 00:52:39,421
I can't really do that now.
So, listen, you get going.

893
00:52:39,423 --> 00:52:43,392
Okay? You teach
that Hollywood prick a lesson.
Okay? You hear me?

894
00:52:43,828 --> 00:52:45,327
Alright.
I will.

895
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:46,662
Hydrate.

896
00:52:49,934 --> 00:52:50,866
Oy!

897
00:52:51,903 --> 00:52:53,836
What's going on?
Is it happening or what?

898
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:56,872
Yeah, it's happening!
The race is still on!

899
00:52:56,874 --> 00:52:59,408
And he agrees.
You're a Hollywood prick!

900
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:00,609
Adios.

901
00:53:12,256 --> 00:53:13,355
Now they tell me!

902
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,612
[Duke] What is this?

903
00:53:38,249 --> 00:53:40,382
[Duke] Hillbilly help!
[voice echoing]

904
00:53:42,687 --> 00:53:43,619
Okay.

905
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:48,490
Is that irritating?
Some shortcut your pal took.

906
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:52,628
[Duke] Hours later,
I hit rock bottom.

907
00:53:53,698 --> 00:53:54,630
[Duke] Literally.

908
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,705
[Duke] It was a miracle
I even found the RV.

909
00:54:07,945 --> 00:54:10,613
Alright, your call.
Hey! What the fuck is that?

910
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:17,453
Come on.
You're putting
the heater on? Seriously?

911
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:19,622
I'm not fucking
Ben & Jerry's, Carl!

912
00:54:19,624 --> 00:54:20,990
[Sebastian]
Freezing in here!

913
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:30,399
You hustling creep!
You got to that cop!

914
00:54:30,401 --> 00:54:33,035
I'm sorry,
I can neither confirm nor deny.

915
00:54:33,037 --> 00:54:35,304
You son of a bitch!
You're gonna play that way?

916
00:54:35,906 --> 00:54:38,040
Look, I've got millions
riding on this, pitchman.

917
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:41,644
Remember all skinning
is allowed in a snake pit.

918
00:54:43,014 --> 00:54:45,381
That's "I'll put
a rattlesnake
in your pocket

919
00:54:45,383 --> 00:54:47,049
and I'll ask for a match,"
you moron!

920
00:54:48,352 --> 00:54:50,352
You're misquoting
Amarillo Slim again!

921
00:54:57,428 --> 00:55:00,863
[Duke] That little stunt
by Sebastian
cost me nearly six hours.

922
00:55:04,335 --> 00:55:07,903
[Duke] So I decided to cash in
on some of my limited
night walking time.

923
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:13,809
[wind blowing]
[Angry] Okay. Oh, look at that.

924
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:15,911
[Hank] You feel that?
[Angry] Whoo!

925
00:55:15,913 --> 00:55:19,381
I'm glad I'm in here
and it's cozy.
Are we gonna play?

926
00:55:19,383 --> 00:55:20,916
[Hank] Some kind
of crazy sandstorm?

927
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,788
[banging the door]
Hey! Let me in!

928
00:55:26,424 --> 00:55:30,359
Yes, can I help you?
I'm blowing away! Let me in!

929
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:34,797
Duke, I'm sorry, big man,
you've already had your break.

930
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,598
We've discussed this.

931
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,034
You cannot a take break
within three hours
of each other.

932
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:43,639
I mean, the rules are rules
unless you wanna concede.

933
00:55:43,641 --> 00:55:45,374
Concede, my ass!

934
00:55:45,376 --> 00:55:48,911
Take your hand
off my door handle.
Dukey?

935
00:55:48,913 --> 00:55:50,679
[Duke]
Sebastian wasn't budging.

936
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,881
[Duke] I had to get
the hazmat suit

937
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:55,484
that Wing had
brought along
for emergencies like this.

938
00:55:55,486 --> 00:55:57,019
Come on,
Sebastian. This is cruel.

939
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:59,355
Let him in!
What do you guys worried?

940
00:55:59,357 --> 00:56:02,558
[Sebastian] If he dies, he dies.
Let my brother in, come on!

941
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,694
[Wing] Yeah!
[laughing]

942
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:08,597
[Duke] I need the hazmat suit.
The hazmat suit!

943
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:10,499
Huh? What's
he trying to say?

944
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:12,067
The hazmat suit!
I need it!

945
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:14,570
Little Dukey.
What's he trying to say?

946
00:56:14,572 --> 00:56:16,839
He's trying to communicate.
He's trying to play charades?

947
00:56:16,841 --> 00:56:18,607
Oh, I love charades.
[Hank] So do I!

948
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:22,644
A thousand bucks a man
to whoever figures it!
Whip out!

949
00:56:22,646 --> 00:56:24,980
[Hank] No one beats me.
I can play
at Betty White's house!

950
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:29,885
[talking at the same time]
Give me something to write!

951
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:33,655
[Wing]
Dirty mag, soft porn.
He's cold. Rock the cradle.

952
00:56:33,657 --> 00:56:36,458
A hazmat suit. Ebola!

953
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:39,428
Wings, wings,
it must be airplane!

954
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,430
He's saying airplane.
Write down "airplane."

955
00:56:41,432 --> 00:56:44,133
[Wing] Airplane.
[Carl] Airplane.

956
00:56:45,102 --> 00:56:48,904
Oh! Not airplane! E!

957
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,607
That's the letter E.
Write down E!

958
00:56:51,609 --> 00:56:53,609
[Wing] Hold on. Hold on.
[Carl] E. E?

959
00:56:55,112 --> 00:56:57,913
Yes! Yes.
Got it!

960
00:56:57,915 --> 00:57:02,618
Second syllable. Looks
like he's pitching softball.

961
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:05,587
[Hank] Betty White cookies.
[Carl] Softball? Yeah, softball.

962
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:07,456
[Carl]
I know what he's doing.
He's bowling.

963
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:09,992
Bowling?
[Carl] Yes. Write down bowling.

964
00:57:09,994 --> 00:57:12,060
[Angry]
Don't know anybody
who bowls like that.

965
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:16,932
Yes! Bowling! Ebola!
I need...

966
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:19,735
[Wing]
He wants the hazmat suit!
He wants the hazmat suit!

967
00:57:19,737 --> 00:57:22,171
[Wing]
Got it! Got it!
I win four thousand dollars.

968
00:57:22,173 --> 00:57:24,840
[Carl]
You'd better hurry.
He's gonna blow away.

969
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:27,476
[Carl] It's not in the fridge.
[Wing] I love this game.

970
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:34,149
[jazz music]

971
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,251
[Duke] Day four was torture.

972
00:58:09,253 --> 00:58:15,791
[Duke] It was 110
in the cactus shade, I was
exhausted before the day began.

973
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:21,230
Hey, Carl.
Duke slowed down
real bad today.

974
00:58:21,966 --> 00:58:25,000
Something's wrong.
Hey, Wing, get out!

975
00:58:26,504 --> 00:58:28,537
[Sebastian] Five minutes.
You know the rules.

976
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:33,208
Duke!
[Duke panting]

977
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:36,278
Don't tell me... You won
another game of charades.

978
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,814
[laughing] No,
I came out for you.

979
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:42,150
You are very slow today...
What? What happens?

980
00:58:42,152 --> 00:58:44,119
You mean
what's happening, Wing?

981
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:45,888
I tell
you say "what's happening."

982
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:47,756
I don't know Wing,
it's a little hot.

983
00:58:48,592 --> 00:58:50,826
My legs,
they feel like cement.
They don't feel good.

984
00:58:50,828 --> 00:58:53,028
[Wing] Uh, oh.
[Duke] Oh, man.

985
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,564
Duke, I'm worried about you.
What? You okay?

986
00:58:55,566 --> 00:58:57,065
Yeah,
I'm okay. I'm okay.

987
00:58:58,102 --> 00:59:00,269
Maybe I'm not.
Maybe I'm not okay.
Alright?

988
00:59:00,271 --> 00:59:04,106
If you ask me, you know,
I think it's your stride.

989
00:59:04,108 --> 00:59:05,807
I don't think
you're walking right.

990
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:07,876
I'm walking right.
I'm just tired of walking.

991
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:11,013
You know what, right now
you look very slow.

992
00:59:11,015 --> 00:59:13,215
You know,
you walk like this.
Like a tired creature.

993
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:17,252
You know
you have to think, like,
a Olympic style speed walker.

994
00:59:17,254 --> 00:59:18,887
You know? Like this.

995
00:59:21,025 --> 00:59:22,291
You look like
you have the runs.

996
00:59:22,293 --> 00:59:23,959
It doesn't matter
what I look like.

997
00:59:23,961 --> 00:59:26,161
This is how the best
walkers move, you know?

998
00:59:26,163 --> 00:59:30,599
Like, uh,
like walking the catwalk
at a fashion show.

999
00:59:30,601 --> 00:59:33,302
Yeah, move
that high knee. Come on,
move that high knee. Let's go!

1000
00:59:33,304 --> 00:59:37,806
Yeah! Yes! That's good, okay.
Now add some speed, okay?

1001
00:59:37,808 --> 00:59:41,577
Yeah! Like, uh, like
you're a model at a cat ramp.

1002
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:44,580
Okay? Give me some attitude.
Attitude! Ah!

1003
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:46,148
It's not bad!
It's not bad.

1004
00:59:49,653 --> 00:59:53,722
And now! Add those arms.
Yes! Like a butterfly! Yes!

1005
00:59:53,724 --> 00:59:56,992
Like a butterfly!
Oh, yeah, you're fine!

1006
00:59:57,928 --> 00:59:59,595
He's got a fucking trainer.

1007
00:59:59,597 --> 01:00:01,163
Swing the arms.
I'm good.

1008
01:00:01,165 --> 01:00:03,865
I told you swing the arms.
You're like a butterfly. Okay?

1009
01:00:03,867 --> 01:00:05,167
Yes!
Think like a butterfly.

1010
01:00:05,169 --> 01:00:07,069
Yes, yes, yes. I'm going.
We fly!

1011
01:00:07,071 --> 01:00:08,370
We're swimming.
I'm going.

1012
01:00:08,372 --> 01:00:10,005
We're swimming
on the ground, yes!

1013
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:14,376
Like De la Renta!
You know, these big legs.

1014
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:19,748
I feel uncomfortable
within my skin.

1015
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,817
And I feel
like I can't look away.

1016
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:26,254
Yes! Yes! Like a butterfly!
Oh yeah, you fly!

1017
01:00:26,256 --> 01:00:29,758
Dukey, you fly!
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

1018
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,094
I'm not a butterfly.
You fly!

1019
01:00:32,096 --> 01:00:36,398
But. But. But, wait.
My hips hurt. My hips hurt.

1020
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,335
I know your hips hurt,
but you got to look
sexy like me.

1021
01:00:40,337 --> 01:00:42,971
[Hank singing]
¶ Dadadada ¶

1022
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:46,008
[Sebastian] Already I look
like Dolph Lundgren's
younger brother.

1023
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:48,677
Now, take your clothes off.

1024
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:52,881
I mean, like,
what if he said that?

1025
01:00:54,284 --> 01:00:56,018
What did you mean by that?

1026
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:57,719
We were goofing on them
doing the voice.

1027
01:00:57,721 --> 01:01:00,439
Why would you say
he's taking his clothes.

1028
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:03,158
Nobody's taking
their clothes off. Already
it's inappropriate enough.

1029
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,127
Why would one of them be naked?
Don't look at me.

1030
01:01:05,129 --> 01:01:06,862
You say way more
disgusting things than me.

1031
01:01:06,864 --> 01:01:09,831
Hey! Hey! Why would one
of them be naked only?

1032
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:12,868
I thought
it would be funny that...

1033
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:15,103
I thought we were doing...
Like doing a bit.

1034
01:01:15,105 --> 01:01:16,805
And one
of them would be naked?

1035
01:01:17,675 --> 01:01:20,042
In the bit.
In the joke.

1036
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:25,213
[Duke] As the day went on,
I continued on guts alone.

1037
01:01:27,718 --> 01:01:31,953
[Duke] The more I tried
to forget the pain...
The more it was there.

1038
01:01:34,892 --> 01:01:38,326
[Wing singing]
¶ Can you bake a cherry pie  ¶

1039
01:01:38,328 --> 01:01:41,697
¶  Billy boy, Billy boy ¶

1040
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:44,966
[Duke] At first I thought
it was psychological
warfare from the gang.

1041
01:01:44,968 --> 01:01:46,802
¶ Darling Billy ¶

1042
01:01:46,804 --> 01:01:49,971
[Duke]
But then it was clear.
Another prop bet.

1043
01:01:49,973 --> 01:01:52,874
[Duke]
How many patriot songs Wing
could sing word for word

1044
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:54,876
in twenty minutes
with an over
and under of five.

1045
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:57,279
Hurrah! Hurrah!

1046
01:01:57,281 --> 01:02:01,850
[Duke] Who knew Wing majored
in patriotic folk music
in college?

1047
01:02:01,852 --> 01:02:03,351
[Duke]
And was a genius in his field.

1048
01:02:03,353 --> 01:02:06,755
¶ ...in is hat
And called it macaroni ¶

1049
01:02:09,293 --> 01:02:11,193
[Duke] Bunch of gambling
degenerates.

1050
01:02:19,503 --> 01:02:22,304
[Duke] Speaking
of gambling degenerates,

1051
01:02:22,306 --> 01:02:25,140
when word spread back
in Hollywood
about the walk to Vegas bet,

1052
01:02:25,142 --> 01:02:27,743
everyone wanted
to be a part of it.

1053
01:02:35,486 --> 01:02:38,820
[Duke] Squeeze showed
at the party and crushed
a few hands.

1054
01:02:40,324 --> 01:02:45,127
[Duke] Even Chucky showed up,
fresh from his new TV series
in a party bus.

1055
01:02:46,029 --> 01:02:49,297
[Duke] With just a few days
to go and still
ahead of schedule,

1056
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:51,133
I decided to press my luck.

1057
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:57,472
[Duke] I took some Korean herbs
that Wing had been saving for me
for emergencies.

1058
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:00,542
[Duke] He swore it
would give me tremendous power.

1059
01:03:13,824 --> 01:03:16,558
[Duke] I started thinking
about my wife KC and my son.

1060
01:03:19,062 --> 01:03:21,863
[Duke] I had to win
this bet. For their sake.

1061
01:03:22,499 --> 01:03:25,000
[Duke] Wing's herbs
were making
me feel sentimental.

1062
01:03:26,403 --> 01:03:28,203
[Duke] I took some more.

1063
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:33,475
[Duke] This was the greatest
day of my entire life!

1064
01:03:37,548 --> 01:03:41,016
[Duke]
Then actress and poker player
Jennifer Tilly showed up.

1065
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:46,454
[Duke] Along with poker pros
Phil Laak
and Antonio Esfandiari.

1066
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:53,312
No!

1067
01:03:53,313 --> 01:03:56,131
[Duke] This bet was getting
so big, there was
a betting line in Vegas.

1068
01:03:58,836 --> 01:04:02,404
When it comes to prop bets,
you should always
bet on the man.

1069
01:04:02,406 --> 01:04:06,308
[Duke] I was at Wimbledon.
I was down five-two
in the fifth set.

1070
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:09,110
[Duke] It was ugly.
You cannot be serious!

1071
01:04:09,112 --> 01:04:11,012
I don't think he can do it.

1072
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,913
Can I sell some of my action
to you because I am not
feeling good?

1073
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:13,882
Yes, I'll take it.

1074
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:19,588
[Duke] What the hell
was I on?

1075
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:26,595
[Duke] Duke's here, yay!

1076
01:04:27,598 --> 01:04:29,364
Duke, I've heard
so much about you.

1077
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:31,032
This is incredible
what you're doing.

1078
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:32,467
Thank you.
This is my girl, Jennifer.

1079
01:04:32,469 --> 01:04:34,069
It's an honor.
Hi, Jennifer.

1080
01:04:34,071 --> 01:04:37,138
So nice to meet you.
You are a legend.

1081
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,940
Everybody is
talking about you.

1082
01:04:38,942 --> 01:04:40,976
Far and wide.
Not just the East Coast.

1083
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:43,144
Talking about you in Europe.
Everywhere, everywhere.

1084
01:04:43,146 --> 01:04:45,080
You can finish
a bet like this.
Do you know why?

1085
01:04:45,082 --> 01:04:46,381
Why?
'Cause you're having fun!

1086
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,950
It's all in
the power of the mind!

1087
01:04:49,453 --> 01:04:52,320
We just wanted to see
how you're feeling
before we put any money down.

1088
01:04:52,322 --> 01:04:53,955
Don't take
any breaks at this point.

1089
01:04:53,957 --> 01:04:55,523
You take a break,
your body will seize up!

1090
01:04:55,525 --> 01:04:57,125
Oh, boy.
How are you feeling?

1091
01:04:57,127 --> 01:05:00,095
Not good.
Oh, we should bet on the...

1092
01:05:00,097 --> 01:05:01,963
Hold up! Hold up!

1093
01:05:03,033 --> 01:05:04,933
I gotta shake your hands.
Oh, okay. Hi.

1094
01:05:04,935 --> 01:05:06,401
No!

1095
01:05:11,174 --> 01:05:13,475
[Duke]
I got out to finish
the rest of the day.

1096
01:05:15,279 --> 01:05:17,178
Wing was right
about those herbs.

1097
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:20,282
For some reason,
I just kept going.

1098
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:27,555
Hey, man! You got a buck
I could borrow, man?

1099
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:28,990
[traffic light] Wait.

1100
01:05:29,993 --> 01:05:31,059
[traffic light] Wait.

1101
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:34,029
[traffic light] Wait.
Hey, forget it, man.

1102
01:05:34,031 --> 01:05:35,931
You're worse off than us.

1103
01:05:35,933 --> 01:05:38,466
I know. But I'm going to Vegas.
[traffic light] Walk. Walk.

1104
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:41,603
[traffic light] Walk. Walk.
Vegas?

1105
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:45,073
You ain't making it
to Vegas, bro!

1106
01:05:45,976 --> 01:05:48,677
You look
like Brad Pitt on crack!

1107
01:05:58,355 --> 01:06:00,422
[Duke] The rest
of the afternoon was hell.

1108
01:06:05,195 --> 01:06:08,496
My knee was starting
to blow up,
and I struggled to go on.

1109
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:12,667
There was
some good news though.
There was a rumor going around

1110
01:06:12,669 --> 01:06:17,372
that Sebastian knew
I was so far out in front,
he might want to settle.

1111
01:06:17,374 --> 01:06:18,640
That kept me going.

1112
01:06:27,184 --> 01:06:30,318
It's over, guys.
I gotta get off this bet.

1113
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,354
What are you talking about?
You're only 90 miles out.

1114
01:06:32,356 --> 01:06:35,023
You're gonna make this easily.
No, man, you don't know.

1115
01:06:35,025 --> 01:06:37,258
My knees are shot.
They're shot.

1116
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:40,362
It's killing me!

1117
01:06:41,631 --> 01:06:43,665
I'm serious.
I gotta get off the bet.

1118
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:47,635
Now look, I say
we settle right now.

1119
01:06:47,637 --> 01:06:51,039
You settle for as much
as possible before this thing
gets really bad.

1120
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:52,407
Well, there he is.

1121
01:06:54,411 --> 01:06:56,711
You're gonna die, huh?
Fucking freezing in that RV.

1122
01:06:56,713 --> 01:06:59,047
[Sebastian] Hey.
Guys.

1123
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:05,720
How're you feeling champ?
Good. Pretty good.

1124
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:07,322
Yeah?
Yeah.

1125
01:07:07,324 --> 01:07:09,357
You look a little shaky
out there, buddy.

1126
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,426
Shaky, no. I'm fine.

1127
01:07:12,462 --> 01:07:14,529
I like it.
Good. Good.

1128
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:15,764
I've been thinking about it.

1129
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,666
I'm thinking 'cause
we're friends, maybe.

1130
01:07:21,438 --> 01:07:22,737
Maybe I'll be
open to a deal.

1131
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:26,241
A deal?
Yeah.

1132
01:07:27,144 --> 01:07:29,711
A deal? Why? A deal, man?

1133
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:32,480
Why would I do a deal?
'Cause you're a dummy.

1134
01:07:32,482 --> 01:07:35,383
I'm ninety miles out.
Got three days to do it,
can probably do it in two.

1135
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:37,218
So.
Do you think he can do it?

1136
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,420
[Carl]
Yes, he's gonna do it.

1137
01:07:38,422 --> 01:07:39,788
Yeah? You got his back, hm?

1138
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:41,289
I tell you what.
Hey, look.

1139
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:45,527
Because I have
this horrible sunburn
and I'm a nice guy.

1140
01:07:46,196 --> 01:07:47,128
You know what?

1141
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:50,732
You give us
three million bucks.
Not a penny less.

1142
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:52,400
And we'll think about it.

1143
01:07:56,273 --> 01:07:57,305
Three million?

1144
01:07:58,608 --> 01:08:01,543
I gotta lock.
We're gonna be
in Vegas two days.

1145
01:08:05,182 --> 01:08:06,114
That's it.

1146
01:08:09,653 --> 01:08:12,487
Yeah. Alright. Alright.

1147
01:08:13,523 --> 01:08:15,457
Call it, square.
What do you think?

1148
01:08:15,459 --> 01:08:18,293
Ah, fuck, I don't know.
I suppose so.

1149
01:08:18,295 --> 01:08:20,195
Works out
for everybody. You know?

1150
01:08:20,197 --> 01:08:21,629
Then it's over?
It's a deal?

1151
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:27,469
Just in time. It's, uh,
a little surprise
I have for you all.

1152
01:08:27,471 --> 01:08:30,472
Just before we
lock this down,
you know, set it in stone.

1153
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:33,341
Come with me.
You're gonna love it!
Come here!

1154
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:40,615
Oh. Thank you,
Lawrence. My friend.

1155
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:47,455
So, guess who I found playing
poker in an Indian casino
down in San Diego?

1156
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:49,324
Any takers?

1157
01:08:49,826 --> 01:08:52,127
Who's under hood number one?

1158
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:56,197
Sandor?

1159
01:08:58,535 --> 01:09:00,401
What the fuck is going on?

1160
01:09:01,338 --> 01:09:02,470
Fucking moron.

1161
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:04,806
He's alive! Thank God!

1162
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:06,741
Yes, thank God! Thank God.

1163
01:09:06,743 --> 01:09:09,911
Shut the fuck up, Carl.
It's a scam. Don't you
understand that?

1164
01:09:09,913 --> 01:09:12,147
Of course he fucking
understands. He's in on it.

1165
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:14,415
Oh!
Come on, guys.

1166
01:09:15,285 --> 01:09:16,518
Why did you do that?

1167
01:09:18,221 --> 01:09:20,255
You motherfucker!
You're next!

1168
01:09:20,257 --> 01:09:21,789
Alright,
everybody get back!

1169
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:25,827
Get out! Go on! You want
it again, you piece of shit?

1170
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,529
You will be dead!

1171
01:09:28,265 --> 01:09:31,199
Get in the bus.
All of you. Move it!

1172
01:09:31,935 --> 01:09:35,170
Come on! Shut the fuck up!

1173
01:09:35,772 --> 01:09:39,440
Who! Whoa! Whoa!
Shut the fuck up!

1174
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:42,610
So this asshole
is still alive?

1175
01:09:42,612 --> 01:09:45,947
Which means there
ain't no will.
There ain't no mil.

1176
01:09:45,949 --> 01:09:47,749
What were you
betting with, Duke?

1177
01:09:48,919 --> 01:09:49,851
Nothing.

1178
01:09:51,588 --> 01:09:53,655
You were using a fake
escrow guy. Right, Carl?

1179
01:09:54,491 --> 01:09:58,293
Yeah. It's true.
My buddy Max.
Great actor.

1180
01:09:58,295 --> 01:10:00,495
Did a lot of theater.
Crossdresser, actually.

1181
01:10:00,497 --> 01:10:02,297
I don't need
a fucking monologue, Carl!

1182
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:08,870
You guys were trying
to rob me? I'm insulted.

1183
01:10:08,872 --> 01:10:12,874
Guys, relax. If I lost the bet,
I was gonna get you paid.
I guarantee it.

1184
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:16,344
What about when you hustled me
with Chuckey's debt? Huh?

1185
01:10:16,346 --> 01:10:19,314
What about
when you made me
climb up that mountain,

1186
01:10:19,316 --> 01:10:21,783
lose six hours
with your cop friend? Huh?

1187
01:10:21,785 --> 01:10:23,885
Whatever happened
to all's fair
in the snake pit?

1188
01:10:25,956 --> 01:10:27,922
I guess he's
kinda got a point.

1189
01:10:27,924 --> 01:10:31,326
Yes. The point is,
is he wasted my time.

1190
01:10:31,328 --> 01:10:33,428
Laid down a bet and he don't
have the money to back it.

1191
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:34,696
It's insulting.

1192
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:39,500
I was hustled.
I'm telling you, Duke.
Even I wouldn't go that low.

1193
01:10:40,003 --> 01:10:42,337
[man] Take it easy.
[man 2] Don't do that.

1194
01:10:43,306 --> 01:10:45,340
Step the fuck back!

1195
01:10:45,342 --> 01:10:48,243
[Sebastian]
This fucking bet is over,
and you guys are done.

1196
01:10:49,246 --> 01:10:50,411
I'll back him.

1197
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:55,250
The dead has risen.
Chucky, you're hammered.
Go back to sleep.

1198
01:10:55,252 --> 01:10:55,984
Why?

1199
01:10:58,488 --> 01:11:00,588
Look, seems to me
this bet could still happen.

1200
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:03,391
You want to take a walk?
[man] Chucky. Alright.

1201
01:11:04,494 --> 01:11:06,594
[Sebastian]
What the fuck are you
talking about?

1202
01:11:06,997 --> 01:11:09,897
See, Chucky,
you can't blow
your money, man.

1203
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:11,899
My knee is bad. It's shot.

1204
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:13,568
Okay, there's
no guarantee out there.

1205
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:16,037
Hey! His fucking
knees are fine!

1206
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:17,905
They've been
that way the whole race!

1207
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:20,341
I'm not worried.

1208
01:11:20,343 --> 01:11:22,577
Okay. No worries.
No worries.

1209
01:11:23,046 --> 01:11:26,814
But the line is no
longer five to one.
It's even money.

1210
01:11:28,318 --> 01:11:31,052
So tell me big boy,
can you get five million
by the morning?

1211
01:11:32,822 --> 01:11:34,856
Yeah. Can you?

1212
01:11:34,858 --> 01:11:37,492
Can I? It's in the van.
My boys just collected it.

1213
01:11:38,361 --> 01:11:42,430
Wait a minute.
There ain't no free ride
for this guy here.

1214
01:11:42,432 --> 01:11:43,931
Chucky, you're down
for four mil.

1215
01:11:43,933 --> 01:11:45,967
But the last mil
is on Duke here.

1216
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:47,935
[Wing] What?
[Angry] Yeah.

1217
01:11:47,937 --> 01:11:49,704
He's gotta
have pain in this game.

1218
01:11:49,706 --> 01:11:51,939
Are you kidding?
I'm broke.
You know that.

1219
01:11:51,941 --> 01:11:54,776
A few seconds ago,
you had a way to cover it.

1220
01:11:54,778 --> 01:11:58,313
Now you're broke.
That's your fucking problem.

1221
01:11:58,315 --> 01:12:00,381
Bad shit's gonna happen
if you stiff me.

1222
01:12:01,551 --> 01:12:04,485
[Sebastian] Alright then.
Bet's back on.
Five million dollars.

1223
01:12:06,022 --> 01:12:06,988
That's it.

1224
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:07,955
A game of poker?
Huh? Come on.

1225
01:12:08,892 --> 01:12:10,992
You fucks have balls,
I'll give you that.

1226
01:12:14,364 --> 01:12:15,697
You're
crazier than I thought.

1227
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:18,466
I'm an actor.

1228
01:12:18,468 --> 01:12:22,704
Besides, you said only
bums don't come back.
I'm betting you're not a bum.

1229
01:12:27,577 --> 01:12:28,910
[Angry]
We're gonna win, right?

1230
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,046
Listen. His knees. Shot.

1231
01:12:32,048 --> 01:12:35,650
His feet no good.
That's real. He's done.

1232
01:12:36,453 --> 01:12:40,521
Tomorrow's gonna be
about one-twenty, so there's
a good chance he might die.

1233
01:12:40,957 --> 01:12:42,023
God willing.

1234
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:53,000
[Duke] Ninety miles
to financial freedom.
I was ready.

1235
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:58,940
I took my maximum
six anti-inflammatories
and was off.

1236
01:13:04,147 --> 01:13:07,582
I took
the old highway hidden away
from the average world.

1237
01:13:15,759 --> 01:13:19,961
I always heard
people that got shot, they
didn't really feel any pain.

1238
01:13:19,963 --> 01:13:21,095
They'd go numb.

1239
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:23,664
That's where I was right now.

1240
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:41,983
Day six was a blur.
I continued on guts alone.

1241
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:51,559
I slept for twelve
hours straight, with
horrible nightmares.

1242
01:13:51,561 --> 01:13:55,163
¶ Home again, when Johnny
comes marching home ¶

1243
01:13:57,434 --> 01:14:01,836
[Duke] I woke
up early drowning in sweat.
I got myself ready.

1244
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:12,013
[Duke] Day seven.
The last day.

1245
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:16,551
[Duke] Twenty-five
miles to the Vegas sign.

1246
01:14:16,553 --> 01:14:18,019
[Duke] I had to do this.

1247
01:14:43,847 --> 01:14:46,214
[Sebastian] It's over.
You're a has been.

1248
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,250
[KC] You're not doing this.

1249
01:14:49,252 --> 01:14:52,820
[KC] We got our lives back
and you're going
to risk everything?

1250
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:55,490
No!
[KC] You're on your own.

1251
01:14:55,492 --> 01:14:57,558
Stay away!
[KC] This is without me.

1252
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,494
[KC] Be a big man.
Put your money down.

1253
01:14:59,496 --> 01:15:01,896
[Angry]
But the last mil
is on Duke here.

1254
01:15:02,699 --> 01:15:05,166
[Angry]
Bad shit's gonna happen
if you stiff me.

1255
01:15:06,936 --> 01:15:09,871
[Angry] You want me
to throw you down
a flight of fucking stairs?

1256
01:15:13,209 --> 01:15:16,043
[homeless man]
You ain't making it
to Vegas, bro!

1257
01:15:30,927 --> 01:15:32,093
How're you doing there?

1258
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,666
You're gonna have to say it.

1259
01:15:41,137 --> 01:15:42,136
You're done.

1260
01:15:50,547 --> 01:15:51,279
Oh.

1261
01:15:53,683 --> 01:15:55,850
Oh. I'm done.

1262
01:15:55,852 --> 01:16:00,588
[cheering and laughing]

1263
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:03,791
With only twelve miles to go!

1264
01:16:03,793 --> 01:16:06,928
Duke Madson cannot
answer the bell.

1265
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:08,696
[laughing]

1266
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:11,265
Alright kids,
what do you say?
Little drinking?

1267
01:16:11,267 --> 01:16:14,569
[cheering]
Hold on everyone! Hold on.

1268
01:16:14,571 --> 01:16:16,671
You might want to hold off
on your celebration.

1269
01:16:16,673 --> 01:16:18,139
What'chu
talkin' bout, Willis?

1270
01:16:18,141 --> 01:16:20,174
[Sebastian] Pour the drink.
[Angry] Please.

1271
01:16:20,176 --> 01:16:23,044
[Angry] What you talking about?
[man] Come on. Alright.

1272
01:16:24,347 --> 01:16:27,114
It's not quite over yet.
What are you talking about?

1273
01:16:27,116 --> 01:16:29,283
I have this.
What the hell are you
talking about Carl?

1274
01:16:29,285 --> 01:16:31,152
I'm talking
about the Jack Binion clause.

1275
01:16:32,855 --> 01:16:35,990
Binion. He's right!
He is right!

1276
01:16:35,992 --> 01:16:38,326
Sit the fuck down.
He's just conceded.

1277
01:16:38,328 --> 01:16:40,161
No, he said "he's done."

1278
01:16:40,163 --> 01:16:42,630
And according
to the Binion clause,

1279
01:16:42,632 --> 01:16:46,200
it says that anyone in the RV
in the last 25 miles
can take his place.

1280
01:16:46,202 --> 01:16:48,336
So we're not done yet.
Yeah! That's right!

1281
01:16:48,338 --> 01:16:49,971
[Wing] Exactly.
[Squeeze] Right!

1282
01:16:51,841 --> 01:16:54,308
Alright.
Alright, yeah. Okay.

1283
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:59,947
It's in here, but it also does
state that I get to choose
who replaces him.

1284
01:17:00,617 --> 01:17:04,218
And I can pick
anyone in this RV. Huh?

1285
01:17:04,854 --> 01:17:07,955
I'm ready.
Anybody I want.

1286
01:17:09,859 --> 01:17:11,025
[Sebastian] Anybody.

1287
01:17:12,695 --> 01:17:15,863
And I pick you, Carl.
[Wing] What? No!

1288
01:17:15,865 --> 01:17:17,365
[laughing] Oh!

1289
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:20,801
You can't do that.
It's not fair.

1290
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:23,638
Hey! You, shut it.
Alright? Zip it.

1291
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,339
You'll be dead
in like three minutes.
Relax.

1292
01:17:25,341 --> 01:17:28,342
The man's on crutches!
He's a gimp. He can't even walk!

1293
01:17:28,344 --> 01:17:30,745
[Sebastian] So, Carl,
what's it gonna be?

1294
01:17:30,747 --> 01:17:32,313
Can you get
your ass out there?

1295
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:34,949
If not, you quit,
just like your brother did.

1296
01:17:36,886 --> 01:17:39,353
Fucking hustler, huh?
I've been called worse.

1297
01:17:39,355 --> 01:17:40,755
Tick-tock.

1298
01:17:43,693 --> 01:17:45,693
Okay. Okay.
Yeah?

1299
01:17:45,695 --> 01:17:48,329
Chop, chop, Sunshine,
cause we've got a...

1300
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:52,833
Hey don't get all
butt hurt on us,
okay, there, sticky boy?

1301
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:55,302
It's a lot of cobblestones
out there as well. Go easy.

1302
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:56,704
[Wing] Good luck, Carl.

1303
01:18:02,045 --> 01:18:04,779
[Hank] You can do it.
You can do it.

1304
01:18:05,281 --> 01:18:07,882
Bro, that's ill advised.

1305
01:18:07,884 --> 01:18:10,451
Look at that little
name dropper go!

1306
01:18:10,453 --> 01:18:13,154
Hey, don't get
too excited, alright?

1307
01:18:15,324 --> 01:18:18,693
He's got twelve miles to go
and three hours to do it in.

1308
01:18:18,695 --> 01:18:20,094
It's basically impossible.

1309
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:23,097
Really?
Yeah.

1310
01:18:25,935 --> 01:18:27,902
What are the odds
on impossible?

1311
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:31,005
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

1312
01:18:31,007 --> 01:18:34,241
Look, that gimp has no chance.
Wait, wait, wait. Shh!

1313
01:18:34,243 --> 01:18:36,377
He's a big boy.
He knows what he's doing.

1314
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:41,148
Feeling frisky?
Are you lush? Huh?

1315
01:18:42,085 --> 01:18:46,253
Give you five to one on it.
Oh! Don't do it. Don't do it.

1316
01:18:46,255 --> 01:18:47,922
I'm in.
[Wing] What?

1317
01:18:48,791 --> 01:18:49,957
Three million more.

1318
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:53,260
Three million?
To your fifteen.

1319
01:18:54,864 --> 01:18:56,864
Fucking hell! He's got
some balls, isn't he?

1320
01:18:58,201 --> 01:19:00,935
I like it! My man knows
how to gamble! I'm in!

1321
01:19:00,937 --> 01:19:02,103
Yeah, baby.
[Wing] Okay.

1322
01:19:06,509 --> 01:19:11,145
[Duke] With the extra
money bet, eight million
on me and Carl now.

1323
01:19:11,981 --> 01:19:13,914
Sebastian was
in for twenty.

1324
01:19:14,884 --> 01:19:16,517
And it didn't look good.

1325
01:19:31,434 --> 01:19:33,534
As time went on,
it was apparent.

1326
01:19:34,804 --> 01:19:36,437
[Duke] Carl wasn't
going to make it.

1327
01:19:37,373 --> 01:19:39,940
This is not right, Sebastian.
The man has no chance.

1328
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:43,244
[Duke] Everyone wanted
the bleeding to stop.

1329
01:19:43,246 --> 01:19:46,514
Wing and Sandor wanted
to settle for eighty cents
on the dollar.

1330
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:50,317
But Sebastian declined.
He wanted all their money.

1331
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:59,126
Chucky, get your dough ready.
No one beats me,
huh, big man?

1332
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:06,433
[Duke]
Then, something
happened to Carl.

1333
01:20:08,204 --> 01:20:12,439
A determination
I hadn't seen since he stole
my girlfriend in ninth grade.

1334
01:20:40,403 --> 01:20:44,338
What the fuck's
he doing now?
Moving like that?

1335
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:46,207
[Angry] You gotta be
fuckin' kidding me.

1336
01:20:48,377 --> 01:20:52,012
What heart,
what determination
from the name dropper.

1337
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:54,415
Now shut
that fucking puppet up,
will you? Fucking shit.

1338
01:20:57,186 --> 01:21:00,855
Is this possible?
Can the gimp
really be doing this?

1339
01:21:02,892 --> 01:21:05,226
[Duke]
Five and a half miles
outside of Vegas,

1340
01:21:05,228 --> 01:21:09,597
with only 42 minutes left,
Carl was still pushing hard.

1341
01:21:13,936 --> 01:21:17,137
Ah! Ah-ha, yeah!

1342
01:21:29,485 --> 01:21:31,118
[Angry]
He's quitting. It's over.

1343
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:34,655
[Angry] It's over!

1344
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:37,157
[Angry] Show me
the money, baby.

1345
01:21:39,595 --> 01:21:41,262
[Angry] What the fuck
is he doing?

1346
01:21:51,107 --> 01:21:53,140
[Wing] Ey... There...

1347
01:21:53,142 --> 01:21:57,278
[cheering]

1348
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:01,115
He's sprinting?
Now he's
fucking sprinting!

1349
01:22:01,117 --> 01:22:03,083
How can he be
doing that?

1350
01:22:10,226 --> 01:22:12,326
[Wing]
He's three miles out!
He can make it!

1351
01:22:16,999 --> 01:22:18,632
[Wing]
He's only got
two miles to go! Go!

1352
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:23,037
Move it!
Ah!

1353
01:22:30,346 --> 01:22:31,412
Go!

1354
01:22:33,249 --> 01:22:36,517
[Duke]
I see the Vegas sign.
Sprint, Carl. Sprint!

1355
01:22:36,519 --> 01:22:38,585
[Duke] Yeah!
[Wing] Yeah!

1356
01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:42,056
Yeah! Yeah!

1357
01:22:46,595 --> 01:22:48,329
[Duke]
He's done it! He's done it!

1358
01:22:48,331 --> 01:22:53,167
[cheering]

1359
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:11,218
[Duke] When Sebastian
went to pay, it was like
he was another person.

1360
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:14,288
[Sebastian]
No dramatics,
no whining, no crying.

1361
01:23:15,624 --> 01:23:18,325
[cheering]

1362
01:23:25,101 --> 01:23:26,033
[elevator bell]

1363
01:23:37,046 --> 01:23:38,679
You had to cut it
to the last minute, huh?

1364
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:42,750
Thought I'd make it
look interesting.

1365
01:23:42,752 --> 01:23:45,619
Besides, I thought
I'd give us a chance
to get more action.

1366
01:23:49,558 --> 01:23:50,524
Here's your cut.

1367
01:23:53,796 --> 01:23:55,329
A million bucks.

1368
01:23:58,501 --> 01:23:59,566
[Duke] What're you
gonna do with it?

1369
01:23:59,568 --> 01:24:03,070
Definitely gonna
hang around here
for a few days.

1370
01:24:03,072 --> 01:24:04,304
Roll the dice with it.

1371
01:24:06,075 --> 01:24:07,741
I'm gonna turn this
into ten mil.

1372
01:24:10,646 --> 01:24:13,380
Ever tell you
about the time I played
craps all night long

1373
01:24:13,382 --> 01:24:15,215
with Johnny Depp
in this very hotel?

1374
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:17,351
It's back when he was
doing 21 Jump...

1375
01:24:17,353 --> 01:24:18,452
Hey! Hey!

1376
01:24:19,155 --> 01:24:21,155
Hey,
Johnny's my best friend!

1377
01:24:21,157 --> 01:24:22,823
A toast! Yes!

1378
01:24:24,093 --> 01:24:26,193
[Duke]
It took Carl three years
to set up his mark.

1379
01:24:26,662 --> 01:24:29,196
So you're telling me
you're gonna walk around
on crutches

1380
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:32,699
for who knows how long
just to set one
of these guys up?

1381
01:24:36,338 --> 01:24:37,538
Yep.

1382
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:39,073
Alright, a toast.

1383
01:24:39,442 --> 01:24:42,543
To my brother Carl.
We did it!

1384
01:24:42,545 --> 01:24:46,513
Twenty million!
[everyone] Yeah!

1385
01:24:47,283 --> 01:24:49,516
Hello.
Sandor is dead.

1386
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:53,720
Wait for it.
Wait for it! Emotion!

1387
01:24:53,722 --> 01:24:54,655
What?

1388
01:25:03,699 --> 01:25:05,365
Who's crushing it?

1389
01:25:05,367 --> 01:25:09,603
Okay, guys!
Pops is leaving!
I love you!

1390
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:10,804
Fuck you!

1391
01:25:10,806 --> 01:25:16,577
Oh, honey, I'm sorry
I was cussing. You know
that we're just acting, right?

1392
01:25:17,546 --> 01:25:18,779
You want
a hot fudge sundae?

1393
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:22,783
We are,
and we always will.

1394
01:25:29,725 --> 01:25:32,759
Well,
we still have each other.

1395
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:41,168
[Duke] Yeah, let's hear it
for Chucky birds!
What a performance!

1396
01:25:43,339 --> 01:25:47,374
Look. Carl does not really
need crutches. It's a sting.

1397
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:49,143
You in?

1398
01:25:55,851 --> 01:25:57,918
[Wing] Duke just inherited
a million dollars!

1399
01:26:00,723 --> 01:26:02,789
[Duke] I never did
go back to the big game.

1400
01:26:02,791 --> 01:26:04,925
With the five million I won,

1401
01:26:04,927 --> 01:26:07,928
with Chucky's four million
dollar free roll incentive,

1402
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:12,299
I spent more time
with my wife and my son
and never looked back.

1403
01:26:13,636 --> 01:26:16,703
Then I landed
a great gig as a poker host
of a big show.

1404
01:26:17,473 --> 01:26:19,640
And I've
been doing it ever since.

1405
01:26:22,745 --> 01:26:25,279
Now,
the big game's behind me.

1406
01:26:25,281 --> 01:26:28,182
And the poker needle
slowly disappears.

1407
01:26:28,184 --> 01:26:29,950
I don't miss
it much either.

1408
01:26:30,953 --> 01:26:33,420
But not a day goes by
that I don't think

1409
01:26:33,422 --> 01:26:36,623
about that bet in the desert
and what we pulled off.

1410
